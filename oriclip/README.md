# Modular Oriclip

One of my interests involves building
[binder clip](https://enwp.org/Binder_clip) sculptures.
The name *oriclip* is inspired by [*origami*](https://enwp.org/Origami),
which stands for *ori* “fold” and *kami* “paper”.
Note that binder clips are sometimes called foldover clip or foldback clip.
