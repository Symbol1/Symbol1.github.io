↑ Artist illustration of *Log-logarithmic Time Pruned Polar Coding*.  The main
  idea of this paper involves pruning the tree of synthetic channels using a new
  criterion.  This makes it possible to prove that the average depth of the
  pruned tree is logarithmic in the maximum depth, which leads to
  log-logarithmic complexity.

  The main contribution of this work is to prove that the pair of exponents,
  one measuring the error probability and the other measuring the code rate,
  achieves the triangle supported by (0,0) and (1,0) and (0,1/2).  It is
  particularly hard to approach (0,1/2).

↑ Artist illustration of *Multilinear Algebra for Distributed Storage*.  In this
  work, I construct a regeneration code named *moulin code*.  This name is
  inspired by the *cascade code* that pioneers this work.  The word "cascade"
  refers to the nested nature of the code, but also means a type of waterfalls.
  I found the word "moulin" means a waterfall within a glacier, which puts a
  reference to Amazon S3 Glacier, a long-term storage service.  Later when I
  proposed this name to Iwan my advisor, his first reaction is asking why
  windmill, the meaning of moulin in French.

↑ Artist illustration of *Parity-Checked Strassen Algorithm*.  This work defines
  a code that allows nine CPUs to compute a matrix-matrix multiplication
  collaboratively.  Ghd collaboration is such that the failure of one CPU does
  not delay the final result.  This is named *Pluto code* because there were
  once nine planets, until someday Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.

  Codes: A Generalization of the Product-Matrix Construction*.  The code defined
  in this work is called *Atrahasis code*.  This name comes from *Atra-Hasis*
  which, according to wikipeida, is a 18th-century BCE Akkadian epic, recorded
  in various versions on clay tab  The tablets.  Several reasons are behind this
  choice: 1.  The epic involves surviving a flood, which is analogous to data
  surviving hard-disk failures.  2.  The clay tablets that hold the epic last
  thousands of years.  3. Clay code is another MSR code.
