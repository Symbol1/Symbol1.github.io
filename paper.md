| [ModerDevia18] | Polar Code Moderate Deviation: Recovering the Scaling Exponent |

[ModerDevia18] focuses on the moderate deviations regime (MDR) of polar coding.
MDR is also called the central limit theorem (CLT) paradigm in some references.
It discusses the relation among block length ($N$), error probability ($P$),
and code rate ($R$) in the region where $P$ is about $\exp(-N^p)$
and R is about $\text{capacity} - N^{-r}$ for some positive numbers $p,r$.

While [ModerDevia18] deals with the classical polar codes
constructed in ArÄ±kan's original paper,
[LargeDevia18] extends the theory to a wide class of polar codes.
