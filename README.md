Interests =
Information theory / coding theory / Shannon theory:
Random coding and polar coding over communication channels.
Distributed storage and distributed computation,
application of algebra and combinatorics to.

See [polar comments](/paper/polar) for meta-explanation of polar coding papers.  
See also [distributed comments](/paper/distributed) for
meta-explanation of distributed storage and distributed computation papers.  

I have once computed, on a supercomputer,
the Tutte--Whitney polynomials of Reed--Muller codes of length 64.
[This GitHub repository](https://github.com/Symbol1/BlueWaters-RM64)
keeps source codes, comments, and results.
