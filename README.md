Interests =
Information theory / coding theory / Shannon theory:
Random coding and polar coding over communication channels.
Distributed storage and distributed computation,
application of algebra and combinatorics to.

For meta-explanations of my works categorized by topics, see:

* [Polar coding comments](/paper/polar)

* [Distributed storage comments](/paper/storage)

* [Distributed computation comments](/paper/compute)

I have once computed, on a supercomputer,
the Tutte--Whitney polynomials of Reed--Muller codes of length 64.
[This GitHub repository](https://github.com/Symbol1/BlueWaters-RM64)
keeps the source codes, comments, and results.
