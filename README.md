I am interested in information theory, specifically
polar coding for noisy channels and sources, and
multi-linear algebra for distributed storage systems.

See [polar comments](/polar) for meta-explanation of polar coding papers.  
See also [storage comments](/storage) for
meta-explanation of distributed storage papers.  

I have once computed, on a supercomputer,
the Tutte--Whitney polynomial of Reed--Muller codes of length 64.
See [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/Symbol1/BlueWaters-RM64)
for source codes, explanation, and results.
